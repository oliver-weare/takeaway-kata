During my time on bootcamp with Makers, one of the challenges we were given was to create a program for ordering takeaways. At the time, it seemed complicated, however a few months have now passed, and my knowledge of Python has improved.

I decided to take that project and form a kata, of sorts. The aim of this is to refactor the code and apply some newly learned skills.
